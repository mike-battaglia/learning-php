# Learning PHP
*My notes for learning PHP.*

## The PHP Tags and Commenting
```php
<?php  
  // This is a single-line comment

  /*
  This is a multiline ("block") comment
  A multiline comment is sandwiched between slashes and asterisks.
  */

  /*
   * Sometimes you'll see block comments with asterisks on each new line.
   * This is an optional style choice.
   */

  // PHP code is enclosed between the opening and closing tags.
?>
```
