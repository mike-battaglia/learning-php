## [PHP Tags](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php) and Commenting

```php
<?php  
  // This is a single-line comment. The line above is an opening PHP tag.

  # This is also a single-line comment.

  // The final line of this code is a closing PHP tag.

  /*
  This is a multi-line ("block") comment
  A multi-line comment is sandwiched between slashes and asterisks.
  */

  /*
   * Sometimes you'll see block comments with asterisks on each new line.
   * This is an optional style choice.
   */

  // Sometimes, people get fancy with their comments, like these:

  //======================================================================
  // CATEGORY LARGE FONT
  //======================================================================

  //-----------------------------------------------------
  // Sub-Category Smaller Font
  //-----------------------------------------------------

  # Question: How do we feel about emojis in comments? ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢

  // PHP code is enclosed between the opening and closing tags. The line below is a closing tag.
?>
```


## Strings
```php
<?php
  
?>
```
